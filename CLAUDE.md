# CLAUDE.md — BillScape Project Rules

## Product
Multi-tenant billing POS SaaS named **BillScape**. Any shop type signs up, configures branding +
enabled features, and bills on Web, Android, iOS against the same live data.
Roles: Super Admin (platform) → Shop Owner/Manager (tenant) → Employee/Cashier.

## Non-negotiable rules
1. Multi-tenancy: EVERY tenant table has organization_id. Enforce isolation with
   Supabase Row-Level Security. No cross-tenant reads, ever.
2. Business logic (tax/GST, totals, rounding, validation) lives ONLY in packages/core.
   Never duplicate it in web or mobile. Every app imports from @billscape/core.
3. QR/barcode is a P0 correctness path. Every scan failure must be handled explicitly.
4. USB hardware scanners are keyboard-wedge devices. Use inter-keystroke timing (75ms threshold).
5. Cashiers must NEVER see cost price, profit, or owner-only reports.
6. Cloud (Supabase) is the source of truth.
7. India GST first: intra-state = CGST+SGST, inter-state = IGST.

## Tech stack (do not change without asking)
- Monorepo: pnpm workspaces + Turborepo
- Web: React + Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind + shadcn/ui (PWA)
- Mobile: Expo (React Native)
- Backend: Supabase (Postgres, Auth, RLS, Realtime, Storage, Edge Functions)
- Shared: packages/core (types, tax, totals, validation), packages/api (supabase client)

## UI Design
- Dark + modern: zinc-950 background, zinc-800 sidebar, indigo-500 accent
- English language UI
- shadcn/ui components throughout
